NewsFlash is the name of my project, planned to be a react based website that provides news on a selection of topics as well as topics that the user can search for.

# MVP

## React

- React Router to link pages together![
- 6 seperate rendered components (In my case this will be different categories of news)
- React File structure will be neat (Hopefully)
- Axios will be used to get data from [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/)
- Storybook will be used to create some reusable components

## Styling

- Plan on using Flexbox for easy responsiveness for Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile
- Storybook will be used for some reused components

## Functionality

Ideally there will be a homepage with top stories across categories, along with 4-5 seperate pages which will display news in specific categories. There should also be a search function for users to find stories based on their search query.
