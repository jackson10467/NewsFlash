NewsFlash is the name of my project, planned to be a react based website that provides news on a selection of topics as well as topics that the user can search for.

# MVP

## React

- React Router to link pages together![
- 6 seperate rendered components (In my case this will be different categories of news)

|App.js|  |
|-|--|
| Nav Component (**Storybook**) | 1 | 
| Homepage Component | 2 |
| Category Page(s) Component | 3 |
| Article Page Component | 4 |
| Search Results Component | 5.0|
| Links Component (**Storybook**) | 5.1|
| Input Component (**Storybook**) | 5.2|
| Button Component (**Storybook**) | 5.3|
| Footer Component (**Storybook**) | 6|


- React File structure will be neat (Hopefully)
- Axios will be used to get data from [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/)
- Storybook will be used to create some reusable components

## Styling

- Plan on using Flexbox for easy responsiveness for Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile
- Storybook will be used for some reused components

## Functionality

Ideally there will be a homepage with top stories across categories, along with 4-5 seperate pages which will display news in specific categories. There should also be a search function for users to find stories based on their search query.
